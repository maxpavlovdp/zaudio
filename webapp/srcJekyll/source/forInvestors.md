###What problem do we solve:###
> <1> Help automakers to comply with minimal noise requirements in [US](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-sets-quiet-car-safety-standard-protect-pedestrians) and [Europe](https://www.unece.org/info/media/presscurrent-press-h/transport/2016/new-un-regulation-keeps-silent-cars-from-becoming-dangerous-cars/doc.html)
 
> In 5 years majority of cars will be driven by autopilot. Manual drive mode will be used only for fun. Fun should be noisy and well recognizable by pedestrians and other drivers.
