###What problem do we solve:###
> Help automakers to comply with minimal noise requirements in [US](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-sets-quiet-car-safety-standard-protect-pedestrians) and [Europe](https://www.unece.org/info/media/presscurrent-press-h/transport/2016/new-un-regulation-keeps-silent-cars-from-becoming-dangerous-cars/doc.html) .
 
> In 5 years majority of cars will be driven by autopilot. Manual drive mode will be used only for fun. Fun should be noisy and well recognizable by pedestrians and other drivers. We build the platform for sound development and distribution.

###Inovations:###
> We build the first platform in the world where sound designers can develop and sell artificial noise (AN) for electric cars. 

> Z Audio device will be fancy upgrade for sport electric cars.

###Plans:###
> Next step is to build prototype of Z Audio device. We need funding to achieve this goal.
