###Sound:###
> Sound creation process is core of our startup. We build the platform like AppStore or Google but instead of apps we sell sounds for electric cars. We believe that genius creative individuals can create better sound then experienced teams in large bureaucratic organizations 
 
###Contribution:###
> If you want to hear your sound on the roads welcome on board! :)
> Currently sound is bunch of ogg files + scheme. If you are interested, ask for instruction in private message on [fb](https://www.facebook.com/pg/zeBoosterLab)
